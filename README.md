# Prompt Engineering

In this repository, I aim to learn Prompt Engineering. My goal is to build an application that will utilize prompt engineering. 

## Project Idea: Review Analyzer

I aim to build an application to analyze customer reviews with the following featuers: 
- Identify the language if the review is not in english
  - Translate to english
- Summarize to a specific department out of the following departments:
  - Sales and marketing
  - Operations and production
  - Finance and administration
- What to include along with the summary
  - Sentiment of the review
  - Emotion the reviewer is expressing
  - Extract the item name they are reviewing
- Suggestions to the department
- An expanded email reply to the reviewer that will include and address the details in the review

How about making this project more interesting by creating the application for an actual company?
